This random walk simulates the wandering of an intoxicated person on a square street grid. 
The drunkard will start out in the middle of the grid and will randomly pick one of the four compass directions, and take a step in that direction, then another step from that new location in a random direction, etc. 
This will be repeated some number of times determined by the user. The output will display the path of the drunkard as a sequence of line-segments.
